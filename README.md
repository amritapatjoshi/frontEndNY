This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server: npm run dev

Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

The `app/api/*/route.tsx` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Additions to note

1. Local port number can be updated from package.json
2. 'npm run lint' to check for lint errors. ESLint will automatically run during 'next build'
3. Few ESLint rules available at: https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/configuring/eslint#eslint-plugin
4. 'npm test' will run jest and watch for changes
5. 'npm run dev' will help work on dev environment and watch for changes
